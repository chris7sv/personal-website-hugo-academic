 abstract = {We describe the MindSet benchmark designed to facilitate the testing of DNNs against controlled experiments reported in psychology.  MindSet will focus on a range of low-, middle-, and high-level visual findings that provide important constraints for theory, provide the materials for testing DNNs, and provide an example of how to assess a DNN on each experiment using a ResNet152 pretrained on ImageNet. The goal is not to evaluate how well ResNet152 accounts for human vision, but rather, encourage researchers to assess how well various DNNs account for a range of key human visual phenomena.},
