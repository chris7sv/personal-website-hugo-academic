abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) have had extraordinary successes in classifying
  photographic images of objects and are often described as the best models of biological
  vision. This conclusion is largely based on three sets of findings: (1) DNNs are
  more accurate than any other model in classifying images taken from various datasets,
  (2) DNNs do the best job in predicting the pattern of human errors in classifying
  objects taken from various behavioral datasets, and (3) DNNs do the best job in
  predicting brain signals in response to images taken from various brain datasets
  (e.g., single cell responses or fMRI data). However, these behavioral and brain
  datasets do not test hypotheses regarding what features are contributing to good
  predictions and we show that the predictions may be mediated by DNNs that share
  little overlap with biological vision. More problematically, we show that DNNs account
  for almost no results from psychological research. This contradicts the common claim
  that DNNs are good, let alone the best, models of human object recognition. We argue
  that theorists interested in developing biologically plausible models of human vision
  need to direct their attention to explaining psychological findings. More generally,
  theorists need to build models that explain the results of experiments that manipulate
  independent variables designed to test hypotheses rather than compete on making
  the best predictions. We conclude by briefly summarizing various promising modelling
  approaches that focus on psychological data.'
