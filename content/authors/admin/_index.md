# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm interested in various processes of visual cognition, such as perceptual grouping, contour integration, shape recognition. More generally, I'm interested in how information is encoded and processed in human vision. I use deep learning to model these processes.

I'm a PhD student in the Generalisation in Mind and Machine lab in University of Bristol. My work deals with evaluating and enhancing deep neural networks as models of cognition.

Beginner classical guitarist, hope to one day be good enough to post my recordings here.

Proud dad of 3-year-old.
